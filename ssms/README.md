# SSMs for industrial pilot

Right now, this pilot **does not** need any SSMs since the reconfiguration tasks will be implemented as FSMs. The deprecated SSMs in this folder are not used anymore.

More information about FSM/SSM implementations for this pilot can be found [here](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-industrial-pilot/wiki/FSM-SSM-Development).
